# Kickstart 1.3 boot bring-up journal

A running log of the reverse-engineering / bring-up work to get the
real Kickstart 1.3 ROM booting on our Verilator-based 68000 sim.
Newest entries on top.  Each entry includes: what we found, how we
found it, and what to try next.  Companion files:

- `kickstart/README.md` — stable summary of fixes + open items.
- `tools/disasm68k.py` — m68k disassembler we use to read ROM.
- `tools/rom_decrypt.py` — strip AMIROMTYPE1 header / XOR with key.
- `tools/mkbootblock.py` — build a minimal Amiga DOS bootblock.
- `tools/adf2mfm.py` — MFM-encode an ADF for our floppy DMA stub.

The boot ROM (`kickstart/kick.bin`, gitignored) is loaded as the
$F80000 ROM image and the boot trampoline at `tests/t63_boot_rom.s`
manually loads SSP / PC from the reset vectors at low chip RAM (which
are ROM-shadowed at OVL=1).  Make target: `make test-kickstart-boot
ROMFILE=kickstart/kick.bin ROMSIZE_WORDS=131072` (or
`make test-boot-rom-bin ...` for the older no-disk variant).

## Session log

Convention: each session opens with a one-line goal and closes with
a `Status:` line describing what runs.  Within a session, each
discovery / hypothesis / experiment is its own bullet.

### S2: `JMP $disp(PC, Xn)` was using A7 as the index

Goal: keep pulling on the render-loop thread; find which exec.library
field is feeding `A0..A4` the bad low-chip-RAM pointers.

- Built `tools/disasm68k.py` (handles MOVE, MOVEA, BSR/BRA/Bcc,
  DBcc, Scc, ADDQ/SUBQ, MOVEQ, LEA, PEA, JMP/JSR, RTS/RTE/RTR,
  LINK/UNLK, MOVE USP, MOVE SR/CCR, MOVEM, ORI/ANDI/SUBI/ADDI/EORI/
  CMPI, register-ALU forms, shift family, TST, CLR, SWAP, EXT).
  Unknown opcodes fall back to `DC.W $xxxx` so we always make
  forward progress reading ROM.

- Disassembled `$F810F6..$F811B6` and recognised the surrounding
  routine as a **bytecode dispatcher**: load a byte at `(A1)+`,
  shift+mask into an index, look up a 16-bit signed offset from
  a small table at `$F81196`, then `JMP $2C(PC, D1.W)` to one of
  ~8 case handlers inside the same routine.  All table entries
  are small negative offsets that land back inside the dispatcher
  loop itself.

- Re-checked our earlier trace: `JMP $F81168 -> $F86EEE`.  Computed
  the math: for that target to be reached, D1 at the JMP must
  equal `$5D58`, far beyond what the byte-dispatch could produce
  ($0..$E from the masked shift).

- Added a focused trace: `[JMP1168] ex_rb=00000000 target=00f86eee`.
  ex_rb (= D1 for K_JMP's index register) reads as 0 — so our
  computed target should be $F8116A + $2C + 0 = $F81196.  But the
  CPU emits $F86EEE instead.  Difference: $F86EEE - $F81196 = $5D58.
  At the time of this JMP, A7 was around `$5D58` (we are deep in
  supervisor calls).  Smoking gun: our `d8(PC, Xn)` reads A7
  instead of the brief-extension-specified Xn.

- Root cause in `rtl/m68k_core.v`: `id_rc_idx` is muxed to the Xn
  register only when `idec_src_mode == EA_IDX` (mode 6).  For
  `EA_EXT / EA7_PCIDX` (mode 7 / reg 3 = `d8(PC, Xn)`) the wire
  defaults to A7.  The EA computation at line 740 then reads
  `ex_sp` (= rc port) as Xn — which is A7's value.

- Fix: extend `id_src_is_idx`/`id_dst_is_idx` to also fire when
  `(src_mode == EA_EXT && src_reg == EA7_PCIDX) && ext_words != 0`.
  Same for dst.  Now Xn for `d8(PC, Xn)` is read correctly.

- Regression: 89/89 pass.  Boot: the previous infinite render loop
  is GONE.  Boot now reaches a `STOP #0` at chip-RAM `$040C`
  (= the inside of the test trampoline's `stop #0`) at
  retired = 2,412,037 with `sp=$5D6A`.  No `[BOOTBLOCK]`, no
  `[DSKLEN]` events yet -- the boot apparently RTS'd to a low-RAM
  address that happens to land in the trampoline's STOP.

Status: render-loop block resolved; next blocker is identifying
which RTS / control-flow op is popping back to `$040C` with a
supervisor stack at `$5D6A`.  Very likely the OLD render-loop
target (`$F86EEE` / the long bitplane scroll) was masking a much
earlier CPU bug, and fixing it exposed the next layer.
